For example, let's say a user wants to change the permission settings of a specific object stored on BNB Greenfield.

As part of this transaction, a message is propagated through the relayer network from BSC to BNB Greenfield. The relayers act as intermediaries, facilitating the communication between the two platforms. The message contains the information about the requested changes to the object's metadata, such as the updated permission settings.
